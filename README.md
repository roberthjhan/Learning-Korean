# Learning-Korean
I'm Korean-American but don't know Korean (to the disdain of my mother and girlfriend). I decided to put a greater effort towards learning my mother tongue and while I seem to be doing well with writing I'm struggling with speaking.
This project will try to help me with pronunciation by using speech recognition to evaluate me.
